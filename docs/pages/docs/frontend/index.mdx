# Frontend Overview

This project ships with two frontends:

- Next.js starter (TypeScript) under `frontends/next-js-starter`
- Streamlit app under `frontends/streamlit-starter`

Pick one (or both) depending on your needs. Each frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000` by default.
