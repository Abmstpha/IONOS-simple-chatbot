# Streamlit Frontend

The Streamlit app provides a quick UI to:

- Initialize RAG with a URL via the `/init` endpoint
- Select a model ID to use for chat
- Send messages to the backend and display responses

## Run

```powershell
# In a new shell
cd frontends/streamlit-starter
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or: pip install streamlit requests
streamlit run app.py
```

Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Configure

- Backend URL is defined in the app as `BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:8000"`
- The model is passed in the `x-model-id` header

## Notes

- If `/init` is not available (backend variant without RAG), you can comment out the initialization block in the sidebar.
